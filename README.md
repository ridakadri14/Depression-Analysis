Depression is a psychiatric disorder that affects people at some point of time but generally ignored.
Social media is one of the major sources to know the happenings of oneâ€™s life.
In this project, we analyzed tweets of people to detect depression using one of the neural network architecture,the LSTM network.
In addition to that, we experimented with different kinds of word embeddings for the input of the network and we got the maximum accuracy in
the pre-trained word embedding of the Glove vectors.
